Write what you have done each time

//Po-Wen pushed on ET 5:26 am with landing page background (assets folder created) and made project description over the background 
//Po-Wen pushed on ET 5:50 re-organized pages, performance page added
//Po-Wen pushed on ET 6:36 background finally centered but size needs to be smaller around 75%
//Adam pushed on 6/22 at 6:36 pm ET with basic navigation, css and content place-holders there.  So far I have all css in a single styles.css that I added and I got rid of main and added a join page.
