Write what you have done each time

//Po-Wen pushed on ET 5:26 am with landing page background (assets folder created) and made project description over the background 

//Po-Wen pushed on ET 5:50 re-organized pages, performance page added

//Po-Wen pushed on ET 6:36 background finally centered but size needs to be smaller around 75%

//Adam pushed on 6/22 at 6:36 pm ET with basic navigation, css and content place-holders there.  So far I have all css in a single styles.css that I added and I got rid of main and added a join page.

//Po-Wen pushed on 6/13 ET 2:55 am ET Did some visual adjustment in spacing, alignment among nav-bar, font size and the circular background. You may see it is more airy between nav-bar, center(group name) and the landing background. I assume the nav-bar is now woking less funky on my update which was a quick fix thanks to increasing paddings between the four navigation menus. I was trying to figure out the big background image and center-image-text thing on mobile setting. My attempt was to remain the background in original size and centered so the description will have room to stretch. I have also made the center-image-text in black for now to see how far it stretches. Unfortunately it doesn't go well at the moment and you can see the background image is leaning toward right.

//Yiru add Video to performance page

//Po-Wen pushed on 6/13 ET 6:24 am ET add indivisual artists folder in assets folder, all artists information filled in artists page
